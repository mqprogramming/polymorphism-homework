# polymorphism-homework

1. Polymorphism means to be able to have and/or change into many different forms.

2. It means that we are able to change objects to be different types - an example of this would be using an interface to reassign the types of made objects to pass into a collection.

3. Interfaces.

4. It can have unlimited forms, but only one at once (?)

5. When you have two different classes of vehicle type and you wish to pass them into an arraylist together, using an interface you could convert them to the same type for passing into the list.



1. Composition refers to 'has a' relationships, meaning objects can be passed as parameters in other objects.

2. If you had a Car class, you could have an Engine object as a property. This is implemented when the property requires more than a simple data structure.

3. The advantages are that long, fragile inheritance chains aren't required and thus refactoring code is much easier; swapping out classes and blocks of code is easy; the structure is easier to follow.

4. They are also destroyed.
